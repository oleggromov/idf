Welcome to the IDF Frontend Code Challenge!
===========================================

There are 2 sub-challenges:
 - [CSS challenge: Images](images/README.md)
 - [JS challenge: Widget](widget/README.md)

## Technical requirements
 1. Use only Vanilla JS (ES5/ES6/ES7).
 2. Don't use a CSS framework (since we would like to evaluate your CSS skills). You can use [CSS normalizer](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) or style reset if you like.
 3. Code should not be minified (we'll review it üßê).
 4. Solutions should work in all evergreen browsers (latest stable versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge). Backward compatibility is **not required** (but it will be a plus for your final score). 
 5. Layout should be adaptive or responsive (as you wish).

## What we will evaluate
 1. Your ability to design project architecture and consistent approach in implementation (frequent atomic commits are welcome!).
 2. Your ability to write readable and reusable code with clean API.
 3. Your ability to write well-structured, scalable, and maintainable CSS code with **smooth animations**.
 4. Your ability to **document** your code *(not all of it; just the gray areas)*.

## Recommendations
Since chasing the perfect is an endless journey, here are some recommendations for you:

 1. Show your strengths first hand (create perfect markup or focus on JS code with a great architecture).
 2. Add comments to code when you know how to improve.

## How to submit your solutions
We expect to get your solution in a git repository. You can use free hosted services like GitHub or Bitbucket. An ideal roadmap for you would be to make an initial commit with the files of this code challenge and then build your solution upon that.

You can submit your solutions in 2 ways:
 1. Build your solution in a public git repository and send us the link.
 2. Don‚Äôt want to create a public repository for personal reasons? You can create a private one (hint: Bitbucket allows you to do it for free) and provide a read access for this username: `idf-dev` (valid for GitHub and Bitbucket).
